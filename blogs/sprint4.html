<h1>Javascript Basics</h1>
<p><strong> How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS? </strong>
<br>"Javascript tells the browser how to change the web page in response to events
that happen." My understanding of Javascript is that it is the function that makes
your website do cool active things, so HTML is the base and structure of the page,
the css is the colouring and design of it and Javascript has a special unique job
of changing the value and adding behaviour to web pages
<br><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong>
<br>Control flow is the order function calls, instructions and looping is a sequence of instruction. So for example if the statement was "How much sleep did you get" the 'if' would be (numHours >= 8) which is if number of hours of sleep was more or equal to 8 hours then it would 'return' "You have had plenty of sleep", 'else' it would 'return' "You need more sleep!"
<br><strong> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals. </strong>
<br> I still dont quite understand this, I have a slight idea but I'm not too sure how to explain it. I will get back to you on this!
<br><strong> Explain what functions are and why they are useful. </strong>
<br>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure and a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it. They are super important because they play a big role. </p>

<h1>Daily Mindfulness</h1>
<p><strong> What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it? </strong>
<br> There is no one around at this time for me to practise this exercise on
so I will have to come back to this.
<br><strong> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice? </strong>
<br>There are three key components to mindful conversations "The first and most
obvious one is mindful listening. The second is “looping,” short for “closing
the loop of communication. The third key component to mindful conversation is
“dipping,” or checking in with ourselves." Out of these three the one I would
probably use the most would be looping, because I feel like this will really
help me have a better understanding about the topic at hand because I tend to
not understand things well or straight away at times. </p>
