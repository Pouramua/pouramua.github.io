  <br><h2>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h2><br>
   <br>Well since I just finished school last year and havent really had a job longer than a year the main leaders that I was faced with were my teachers. As probably everyone else, I've been faced with good and not so great leaders, and there is a huge difference, a good leader or in this case teacher would be someone who is passionate about what they teach and helping their students to achieve their goals and blossom, hei poipoi i taua tauira kia puawai. Whereas a not so great leader would be someone who doesnt put the effort into your education and helping you to eke ki nga taumata tiketike. <i>(Apologies for the Maori parts, my english is terrible when it comes to expressing stuff, I express it better in Maori)</i> I have experienced both of these types of leaders and it is not the greatest, I use to have a teacher who would hand out our assignments and when we would ask her how to do something she would reply with "Just google it". Then I'be had amazing teachers where you have a personal connection with them.<br>
  <br><h2>Multiplying Goodness & Tonglen Meditations</h2><br>
<br>This meditation exercise wasn't too bad I enojyed it a little bit but I'm not too sure how it left me feeling. I'm also not really a meditating type of person, everytime we are asked <i>"How did you find it?"</i> I never really know what to say, I guess I'm a little rusty and everytime we do them I'm sort of always rushing them so complete my assignments but if I wasn't busy and had some free time to actually properly focus it would probably be a different story. But overall I enjoyed spreading goodness out to my family members, friends and anyone else I could think of, as for the Tonglen meditation I found it a little, I'm not too sure how to explain it.<br>
<br><h2>SCARF model</h2><br>
<br>I guess each one these have applied to me in one way or another throughout Phase 0 and will continue to apply to me through Bootcamp. Totally agree on the <i>uncertainty</i> and how it can nag at your brain and it <i>“takes away valuable brain resources”</i>. For example the fact that if I dont keep up with my work I could roll back and not graduate by the end of the year meaning I wont get to spend christmas with my family, the small amount of time I spend with my baby will drag out longer and all my plans will fall apart. I think about this all the time, I love spending time with my son and I really want to graduate at the right time. <br>
<br><h2>Difficult Conversation</h2><br>
<br>I find these exercises quite hard, because I never really know how to start the story or how to write the others feeling or even my own because my writting is shocking and I'm not that great with being descriptive! I'm the type of person who looooooves avoiding difficult conversations, last year was a very bad year for me and there were many many times I had to have a 'difficult conversation' about the same topic but I completely avoided them, and it was a very bad habit of mine but I just hated talking about this thing and I didn't really like expressing my feelings to anyone else other than my best friends, but now I'm not too bad I've grown out of it.<br>
