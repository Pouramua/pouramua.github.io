  <br> <h2>What 'scope' is, and how it works in JavaScript.</h2><br>
   <br>Heres some of the resources we were given about <a href="https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/js-scope">Scope</a>,
   last week & a youtube video about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoFlcv2ByBo">The Basics of Scope in JavaScript</a>.
   After watching this video I learnt that there are two types of scope, 'Local Scope' & 'Global Scope'.<br>
   <i><u>Local Scope</i></u><br>
   <br> A local scope is a variable which is either a variable declared within
   the function or is an argument passed to a function.
   <i><u>Global Scope</i></u><br>
   <br> A global scope means that it is visible (hence accessible) throughout
   the program, unless shadowed. The set of all global variables is known as
   the global environment or global state.

     <br><h2>Techniques for growing 'Trust & Sincerity'</h2><br>
    <br>I'm a pretty trusting person, I trust people to begin with and as I get to
   know them more and more my trust either grows or it slowly fades in certain
  situations. I have been to 14 different schools-highschools and I've had to make
 new friends many many times, and I've learnt how to listen and trust lots of new
and different people, so my trust is already quite open.<br>

<br><h2>Empathic Listening?</h2><br>
 <br>Theres no one around at this moment to try this on but I will come back
  to this as soon as I can. Trying to come back to this but the only free time I
   get to do work is late at night when my baby is asleep and obviously everyone
    else is asleeep also. But I wouldnt mind giving this exercise a go!<br>

          <br><h2>Loving Kindness Meditation?</h2><br>
         <br>I thorougly enjoyed this excercise, it helped me quite a lot with a
        situation I had a little trouble with last year, 'young love' I had been
       with my partner for about a year until one day I fell pregnant to him and
      after that things started going down hill and fast, we lost our spark. He
     does a lot of silly things that lean a lot to the wrong side and make me a
    little sad at times, but after doing this exercise I realise that maybe
   “been sad, disappointed, angry, hurt, or confused, just like me” or maybe
  “This person wishes to be free from pain and suffering, just like me”.
 Overall this exercise was a very nice eye opener and made me feel happier.<br>

<br><h2>Political Awareness</h2><br>
 <br>This exercise is quite hard for me because I cant think of anything to
  write about and my writing is shocking, I'm not that gerat at descriptive writing.<br>
