   <h1>Reflection</h1>
   <p> Week one down, eight more to go! For Phase 0 that is. What an experience,
   it has been quite the rollercoaster for me. Day 1 I was reading through all
   my orientation notes downloading everything I need and getting straight into
   work but by the time week 1 ended I realised I had missed a couple orientation
   links and my laptop had crashed meaning I needed a new one, and with a sick
   baby at home needing my attention 24/7 I was freaking out at how behind I was.
   We are now in week 2, I have a new laptop, my baby finally returned to Kohanga
   on Tuesday and I spent a good 10 hours trying to read through everything again
   proper and finishing my work. Im currently enjoying this course and I cant
   wait to see whats in store for us all in the next few weeks.
   Im quite shy to ask for help, but I'll slowly come out of my shell.
   My expectations certainly have not dropped, I was told that this course is
   really intense but really good, I've heard quite highly about it, which made
   me want to attend it even more, but it is indeed living up to its expectations.
   Im super excited as well as nervous to carry on with this work.
    </p>

   <h1>Time & Habits</h1>
   <p> I've recently move to Wellington for this course. I am a single mother to
   a 9 month baby, Noema. I absolutely loved being a stay home mum, but my brain
   was craving for some knowledge. I had baby straight after 7th form and have
   been on break since, now that he is getting older I figured I better do some
   studies. So now I'm in full-time study, well atleast from 9am - 3pm weekdays.
   I've tried Pomodoro which is really good, I use to be quite the procrastinator
   when it came to school but I've been quite good with this work lately, cutting
   all distrations out and taking 5 minute breaks every half an hour unless
   I'm on a good roll. I need to work on dedicating 10 minutes a day on touch
   typing practices.
