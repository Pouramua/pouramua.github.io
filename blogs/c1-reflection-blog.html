         <p> Week one down, eight more to go! For Phase 0 that is. What an experience,
it has been quite the rollercoaster for me. Day 1 I was reading through all
my orientation notes downloading everything I need and getting straight into
work but by the time week 1 ended I realised I had missed a couple orientation
links and my laptop had crashed meaning I needed a new one, and with a sick
baby at home needing my attention 24/7 I was freaking out at how behind I was.
We are now in week 2, I have a new laptop, my baby finally returned to Kohanga
on Tuesday and I spent a good 10 hours trying to read through everything again
proper and finishing my work. Im currently enjoying this course and I cant
wait to see whats in store for us all in the next few weeks.
Im quite shy to ask for help, but I'll slowly come out of my shell.
My expectations certainly have not dropped, I was told that this course is
really intense but really good, I've heard quite highly about it, which made
me want to attend it even more, but it is indeed living up to its expectations.
Im super excited as well as nervous to carry on with this work.
