 <h1>Cultural Blog</h1>
  <br><h2>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h2><br>
   <br>In my youthful days I guess I was living a type of pleasurable life going out
    every weekend with all my friends, dodging school work and being a free spirit,
     on a "high" at that time of my life but as it says in
      <a href="https://siyli.org/resources/#_book">"Search Inside Yourself"</a>
     in Chapter 6, it is very hard to maintain that type of lifestyle, because back at
    school I never really knew what I wanted to do for my career or study all I knew
   is that I didnt want to go to University. After school I was a bit bummed because
  all my friends knew what they wanted to do and where they wanted to study but last
 year was a big eye opener for me to the passion and purpose lens. After finding
out I was pregnant I knew I had to give my life a purpose for my babys benefit,
 and so I found out about EDA and I had a little passion for coding so away I went
  into the big city to learn this foreign thing, because my hometown is very small
   and there aren't many jobs, many people are on the DOLL and don't know much outside
    of that town so in order to be able to live you need to create work for yourself
     or move away basically. So I figured this type of work would be perfect for me
      and what I really want to do is go back to my hometown and teach people about
       coding and web design show them that theres so much out there! So Im now living
        in the passion lense trying to make a career for myself. <br>

        <br><h2>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,</h2><br>
       <br>What are my core values? & What do I stand for? These are pretty hard
      questions for me, I've never really thought about it until now, I guess they would be
     <li><u>Honesty:</u></li>
    <li><u>Happiness:</u></li>
   <li><u>Treating people right:</u> </li>
  <li><u>Family & Friends:</u> </li>
 and ofcourse...
<li><u> To teach my son to be a much better me</u></li><br>

<br><h2>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h2><br>
 <br>I found them okay, I guess they didn't really relate to me yet, there are
  three parts of 'Resilience' which are Inner calm, Emotional resilience &
   Cognitive resilience. Im not too sure which one I lean towards but on the
    emotional topic sucess and failure both have their pros anc cons in some way,
     by teaching you from your wrongs and letting you know what will work for nect
      time I guess, I'm not sure I'm just typing words now.<br>
       <br><br>
