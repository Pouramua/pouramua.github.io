<p> I've recently move to Wellington for this course. I am a single mother to
 a 9 month baby, Noema. I absolutely loved being a stay home mum, but my brain
 was craving for some knowledge. I had baby straight after 7th form and have
 been on break since, now that he is getting older I figured I better do some
 studies. So now I'm in full-time study, well atleast from 9am - 3pm weekdays.
 I've tried Pomodoro which is really good, I use to be quite the procrastinator
 when it came to school but I've been quite good with this work lately, cutting
 all distrations out and taking 5 minute breaks every half an hour unless
 I'm on a good roll. I need to work on dedicating 10 minutes a day on touch
 typing practices.
