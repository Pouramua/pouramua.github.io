 <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
  <br>As a beginning coder you are faced with errors daily. Im forever receiving
   the message "Syntax error". So by solving this problem I have been learning how
    to proof read all my work more often and making sure all my syntax is correct
     and every little comma or semi-colon are in their right places <br>

       <br><h2> Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2><br>
      <br> I havent really looked into "Pseudocode" yet, but I'm forever just typing
     random stuff seeing what works and if I get too hoha I end up using my bestinf
    friend google, and always reading my "Error Messages" not to sure how the
   "Console.log" works to solve problems, and I havent really asked my peers/cohort
  for help because whenever I'm stuck on something I'm already behind and everyone
 has already passed me so I either ask my tutor or Improving your process with
reflection <br>

<br><h2>Explaining to my non-tech friend</h2><br>
 <br><li>.map()
  <br> just like filter map is a function that will take an array and transform
   that into an array of the same length it will also go through an array but unlike
    filter it doesnt throw theobjects away it transforms them.
     <br><li>.filter()
      <br> filter is a function on the array that accepts another function as its
       arguement which it will use to return a new filter but it will also transform
        an array into a smaller array.
         <br><li>.reduce()
          <br> reduce can be used to express any list transformation you can always fall
           back on it if you cant find a pre build list transformation that fits your problem.

    <h1>Self Confidence</h1>
   <br><h2>Mindfulness & Self Awareness?</h2><br>
  <br>Back in Chapter 4 of <a href="https://siyli.org/resources/#_book">Search Inside Yourself</a>
 we learnt a bit about <a href="https://pouramua.github.io/blogs/sprint4.html">Daily Mindfulness</a>
and the key components to mindful conversation, the relationship between these two are ****<br>

<br><h2>Body Scan (Settling Attention)</h2><br>
 <br> I really enjoyed all these exercises I tried them all, I have never taken
  notice of my body parts and their own emotions, I think of myself as an average
   emotinal person sometimes I can be very emotional and sometimes I am emotionless.
    But being able to connect with my entire body all at once was really relaxing
     and nice, it made me more aware of my inner emotions and taking notice of them
      because I was unaware before.<br>

    <br><h2>"My Emotions are Not Me"</h2><br>
   <br>An important lesson I learnt from this chapter is gaining knowledge about my
  emotions and how they are not us and we dont become them we just simply feel them
 “Emotions go from being existential (“I am”) to experiential (“I feel”)”<br>
