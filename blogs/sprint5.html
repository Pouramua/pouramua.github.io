    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
<br>As a beginning coder you are faced with errors daily. Im forever receiving the message "Syntax error". So by solving this problem I have been learning how to proof read all my work more often and making sure all my syntax is correct and every little comma or semi-colon are in their right places <br>

<br><h2> Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2><br>
     <br> I havent really looked into "Pseudocode" yet, but I'm forever just typing random stuff seeing what works and if I get too hoha I end up using my bestinf friend google, and always reading my "Error Messages" not to sure how the "Console.log" works to solve problems, and I havent really asked my peers/cohort for help because whenever I'm stuck on something I'm already behind and everyone has already passed me so I either ask my tutor or Improving your process with reflection <br>

     <br><h2>Explaining to my non-tech friend</h2><br>
     <br><li>.map()
       <br> just like filter map is a function that will take an array and transform that into an array of the same length it will also go through an array but unlike filter it doesnt throw theobjects away it transforms them.
     <br><li>.filter()
       <br> filter is a function on the array that accepts another function as its arguement which it will use to return a new filter but it will also transform an array into a smaller array.
     <br><li>.reduce()
       <br> reduce can be used to express any list transformation you can always fall back on it if you cant find a pre build list transformation that fits your problem.

 <h1>Self Confidence</h1>
 <p><h2>Mindfulness & Self Awareness?</h2><br>
<br>Back in Chapter 4 of <a href="https://siyli.org/resources/#_book">Search Inside Yourself</a> we learnt a bit about <a href="https://pouramua.github.io/blogs/sprint4.html">Daily Mindfulness</a> and the key components to mindful conversation, the relationship between these two are ****<br>
<br><h2>Body Scan (Settling Attention)</h2><br>
<br> I really enjoyed all these exercises I tried them all, I have never taken notice of my body parts and their own emotions, I think of myself as an average emotinal person sometimes I can be very emotional and sometimes I am emotionless. But being able to connect with my entire body all at once was really relaxing and nice, it made me more aware of my inner emotions and taking notice of them because I was unaware before.<br>
<br><h2>"My Emotions are Not Me"</h2><br>
<br>An important lesson I learnt from this chapter is gaining knowledge about my emotions and how they are not us and we dont become them we just simply feel them “Emotions go from being existential (“I am”) to experiential (“I feel”)”<br>
