   <h1>Html, Css & Dom P1</h1>
<p><h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM?
How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2><br>
<br> HTML is like the structure of your house the walls, the roof, the doors etc.
CSS is the colour schemes and designs of the things in your house, like the
colour of the wallpaper. Dom is the thing that controls the certain stuff in
your house like the remote to turn the tv on or open the garage door.<br>
<br><h2> What is meant by boxifying design? </h2><br>
<br>It meants that everything on your screen is within a box, every single thing
on your screen is in their own individual boxes, even cicles and triangles.<br>
<br><h2> What is the box model? </h2><br>
<br>HTML elements are considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model"
is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially
a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders,
padding, and the actual content.<br>

<h1>Html Css & Dom P2</h1>
<p><h2> What is grid based design? </h2><br>
<br> Grids are a way of putting structure towards evvrything o a wedpage in an
orderly type of way by presenting information wiht an effective design and layout.
It makes clear visual path for the eye to see.<br>
<br><h2> What's all the hype about responsive webpages? </h2><br>
<br> I think its quite cool, being able to view a single webpage in different
forms to match the devide you are viewing it on. What a pain having to view an
entire desktop view on a small iPhone.<br>
<br><h2> What is semantic structure? </h2><br>
<br><img src="http://dontcodetired.com/blog/image.axd?picture=2012%2F7%2FSemanticStrucuralWireframe600.png" height="300" width="200"><br>
<br> Semantic structure is the way we as developers use HTML tags to define its
presentation or look by making it easier for browsers to view content on the page.<br>

        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <br> On our first week of EDA we were told to read the book <a href="https://siyli.org/resources/#_book">"
     Search Inside Yourself"</a> and well I'm a bit of a procrastinator when
    it comes to reading books and especially writing things, but I have
   finally made myself read and watch the first chapter. Some of the thing
  that I learnt from this chapter were first of learning the definition
 of what Emotional Intelligences is, “The ability to monitor one’s own
and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to
 use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.” and second
  the five domains that it splits into which are;
   <br>
    <br> 1. Self-awareness: Knowledge of one’s internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions
     <br> 2. Self-regulation: Management of one’s internal states, impulses, and resources
      <br> 3. Motivation: Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals
       <br> 4. Empathy: Awareness of others’ feelings, needs, and concerns
        <br> 5. Social skills: Adeptness at inducing desirable responses in others”
       <br>
      <br> I found the two minutes of mindfulness quite good, I havent been able to do any
     maditation at all since I have started at EDA, because I try to do as much work
    as I can while my baby is away and I spend all my time with him when he is home
   and Im super lazy in the weekends, but I tried two minutes in bed and in the
  shower and it was really nice! I do spend a lot of time thinking about the future
 and past and not so much in the present so I am looking forward to doing this
exercise more often.</br>
