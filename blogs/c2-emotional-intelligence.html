      <p> On our first week of EDA we were told to read the book "Search Inside Yourself" and well I'm a bit of a procrastinator when it comes to reading books and especially writing things, but I have finally made myself read and watch the first chapter. Some of the thing that I learnt from this chapter were first of learning the definition of what Emotional Intelligences is, “The ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.” and second the five domains that it splits into which are;

        <li> 1. Self-awareness: Knowledge of one’s internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions </li>
        <li> 2. Self-regulation: Management of one’s internal states, impulses, and resources </li>
        <li> 3. Motivation: Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals </li>
        <li> 4. Empathy: Awareness of others’ feelings, needs, and concerns </li>
        <li> 5. Social skills: Adeptness at inducing desirable responses in others” </li>

        I found the two minutes of mindfulness quite good, I havent been able to do any maditation at all since I have started at EDA, because I try to do as much work as I can while my baby is away and I spend all my time with him when he is home and Im super lazy in the weekends, but I tried two minutes in bed and in the shower and it was really nice! I do spend a lot of time thinking about the future and past and not so much in the present so I am looking forward to doing this exercise more often. </p>
