  <h1>Bloging about my experience at EDA</h1>
  <p>Im in the Piwakawaka Cohort. We started on the 15th of August 2016 and I think our graduation date is the 16th of December 2016</p>

  <h2><a href="">Week 1</a></h2>
  <br> This week has been quite the blast EDA is exactly what I thought it would be and even better, I was super behind this week with my baby being sick but onwards and upwards I will for sure catch up next week. <br>
  <h2><a href="">Week 2</a></h2>
  <br>So far things are looking good Im feeling much better this week than last week. <br>
  <h2><a href="">Week 3</a></h2>
  <br>This was one of my best weeks where I caught up on all my work, thank goodness but Im quite slack at posting on Slack my "#myhomepage" etc, I sometimes get shy because mine arent as good as others. <br>
  <h2><a href="">Week 4</a></h2>
  <br> I have been super behind this week got caught up doing other stuff, Im really gutted because I was getting excited that my work was for once up to date but oh well. I pretty much completed most of my work for this week on time the only things that rolled over were the JavaScript Pratices and the Tech Blog.<br>
  <h2><a href="">Week 5</a></h2>
  <br>Ive spent a lot of this week catching up on work from week 4 and spending a lot of time doing my web page, making it look pretty and all sorts. Its only Wednesday so hopefully I get all my week 5 work done.<br>
  <h2><a href="">Week 6</a></h2>
  <br>As always this week I was still doing work from the previous week, then my baby got sick again and I've just travelled 10 hours back to my hometown for the holidays to spend some time with my family before Phase 1 starts, I found the work from week 5 really quite and I just breezed through my work, but I'm getting a little bit stuck on this weeks work, just knowing for sure what things are, eg. the work in my <a href="https://waffle.io/piwakawaka-2016/piwakawaka-2016/cards/57defdacc43bf53200b7be19">6.1 waffle card</a><br>
